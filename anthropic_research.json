      "content": "Anthropic's meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company's income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic's enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding. Anthropic's customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. As AI-powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy's most important sectors.",
