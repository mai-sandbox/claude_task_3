OpenAI is an American artificial intelligence (AI) research organization consisting of two entities: OpenAI Inc., a nonprofit research segment, and OpenAI Global LLC, a for-profit subsidiary established to commercialize its AI technologies and applications. As OpenAI continued developing its AI technologies, it learned that its anticipated cost of production would exceed the capital it was able to raise through standard nonprofit channels. This third iteration—among the most advanced AI models for processing language and generating human-like text—would later power OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT platform. Also in May, OpenAI released ChatGPT-4o (“omni”), which can process and generate text, images, and audio in real time—a type of AI known as a multimodal model.",
